# Sudoku Solver (Haskell)

A sudoku solver written in Haskell. First "real" haskell project, excluding toy examples.

Also using this as an opportunity to experiment with "real-world" workflow tools, like "proper" build toolchains (stack) and test suites (tasty, tasty-hunit, tasty-quickcheck) and CI (travis).
